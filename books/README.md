## Standard Micronaut REST/Kafka client application

A simple Micronaut service endpoint demonstrates the development to write a REST controller and a kafka client. Kafka
messge sent the "analytics module" Kafka listener.

### Development Effort

* REST controller - Very simple
* Micronaut Kafka - Simple (minor issues, maybe due to lack of knowledge)
* Micronaut Integration Test (REST + Kafka) - Simple.
* No Java config class needed at all.
